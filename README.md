# GANs-for-time-series-generation
GANs for time series generation and pattern generation.

This repository contains both code and a report for a Machine Learning assignment centered around Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for pattern generation. The primary objective of the assignment was to gain familiarity with GANs and their application in generating patterns.

The initial three sections of the assignment primarily concentrate on generating patterns based on a specified 2D distribution. The final part delves into time series generation, utilizing Yahoo Finance data, particularly focusing on generating time series related to Amazon (AMZN) stock.
